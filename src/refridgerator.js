//use either es6 or commonjs method to import code here


//Use the function that you created that returns a random food inside refridgerateFood(). 
// refridgerateFood should console.log 'i am refridgerating the food - {food}'

const refridgerateFood = () => {

}

refridgerateFood();


//Woohoo! Notice how we built a module that was used in separate contexts. That's keeping your code DRY.
